This project is a "Sudoku Solver with Graphical Display", built using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). 
Here's a simple breakdown of what it does and how it works:

Project Overview:
This program **solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle** entered by the user and then **displays the solved puzzle visually** in a window using SFML.

How It Works:
1. Input Sudoku Puzzle
* The user is asked to enter the Sudoku puzzle in the terminal.
* Enter `0` for any empty cell.
2. Sudoku Solver Logic (Backtracking Algorithm)
* The function `solve()` uses **backtracking** to try different numbers (1 to 9) in each empty cell.
* It checks if a number can be placed using the `suitable()` function which ensures:
  
  * The number is not repeated in the same row.
  * The number is not repeated in the same column.
  * The number is not repeated in the same 3x3 box.
  * The number is not repeated in diagonals (extra constraint, not in standard Sudoku).

3. Displaying the Solved Puzzle using SFML:
* After solving, a 600x600 window opens.
* A Sudoku grid is drawn using lines:
  * Thick black lines every 3 rows/columns.
  * Thin gray lines for individual cells.
* Numbers are drawn in each cell using a font (`arial.ttf`).
  
Visual Output:
* Each number in the solved puzzle is displayed in a cell on the grid.
* The grid looks like a standard Sudoku board with clear separation of 3x3 boxes.
  
Requirements:
* SFML library installed.
* arial.ttf font file in the same directory.
  
Key Features:
* Solves most valid Sudoku puzzles using backtracking.
* Clean graphical display using SFML.
* User-friendly input via terminal and visual output in a window.
